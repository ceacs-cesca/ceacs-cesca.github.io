	                            <p>Culture is reflected in the attitudes and behaviours within the organization and determines what is encouraged or discouraged. Employees face implicit expectations that will affect the decisions they make each day as part of their work. This can be seen in many aspects of your day-to-day activities.</p>
	                            <p>For example, the priority you place on ensuring systems are accessible, how you allocate resources and investments and the way people with disabilities are treated each day is a reflection of your culture.</p>

	                            <h4>Why culture matters for service delivery</h4>
	                            <p>There is a saying that &ldquo;culture eats strategy for breakfast&rdquo;&hellip; will your strategy to improve the accessibility of client services survive the ingrained attitudes and behaviours of your organization?</p>
	                            <p>Organizations cannot develop procedures for every possibility, at some point client service staff will need to adapt. How they adapt will be guided by the organization&rsquo;s culture. Over time culture will counter the best intentions as it is encompassed in the beliefs and behaviours&nbsp;of employees.</p>
	                            <p>Legacy policies and procedures can create hurdles for staff wanting to ensure a person with a disability can access a service of benefit. An organization&rsquo;s policies indicate expectations that can re-enforce an outdated culture. A renewed focus on accessibility needs to be holistic.</p>
