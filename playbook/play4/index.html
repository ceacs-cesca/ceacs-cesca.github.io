                        <h3>Inclusion Principal: Universal Design</h3>
                        <p>Universal design is an approach to intentionally design and deliver programs and services without creating barriers. While it helps ensure inclusion of persons with disabilities, it is seen as good design practice that meets the needs of anyone who needs to access your programs and services.</p>
                        <section>
                            <h4>Universal design is based on 7 principles<sup id="ftnref1"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#ftn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup></h4>
                            <ol class="lst-spcd">
                                <li><strong> Equitable use. </strong>Offer the same service and information where possible and where this is not possible, ensure equivalent access. For example, someone who needs more time to process or remember information, make it so online application forms have no time limits to allow for breaks, a longer pause, or recovery at a later date with a save for later option.&nbsp;</li>
                                <li><strong> Flexibility in use. </strong>Provide clients with various options in how they would like to use the program or service. For example, establish different ways for clients to provide feedback, complaints, and suggestions across all of your channels such as an online form, in writing or over the phone using a relay service, if required.</li>
                                <li><strong> Simple and intuitive to use. </strong>Reduce complexity and ensure it is easy to accommodate the various literacy and language skills. For example, provide signage at every point of access and in alternative formats such as the use of wayfinder beacons, content in braille or large print to reduce anxiety and confusion.</li>
                                <li><strong> Perceptible information. </strong>Information is communicated effectively regardless of the client&rsquo;s ability. For example, support media players that display captions and provide audio options with adjustable size and colour for someone that is deaf or has low vision.</li>
                                <li><strong> Tolerance for error. </strong>Encourages design to minimize hazards and poor outcomes or accidental or unintended actions. For example, display furniture to ensure that no object is obstructing and avoid people tripping or falling over chairs that are misplaced.</li>
                                <li><strong> Low physical effort. </strong>Design does not require undue effort and can be used efficiently. For example, conduct a daily accessibility assessment of your service area&nbsp;such as take notice of building or city renovations that are underway or test functionality of door openers.</li>
                                <li><strong> Size and space for approach and use.</strong> Provide enough space for people standing and seating while they are using an assistive device. For example, have multi-level service counters to accommodate wheelchairs or give the ability to someone with physical limitations to utilize as a supported piece of equipment.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <div class="ceasc-quote billy">
                                <p>Inclusive design is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility. Don't be reluctant to connect with people such as subject matter experts, policy makers, designers and front-line staff.</p>

                        <h3>Leave no one behind</h3>
                        <p>Services are often designed and delivered in ways that create obstacles for persons needing the service. Clients often face multiple barriers and a single barrier can be enough to keep an individual from accessing service &ndash; even if a service is &ldquo;technically accessible&rdquo; by meeting existing standards&hellip; Always ask yourself if your client is actually able to access the service.</p>
                        <p>For example, if you only target &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; clients, you will probably end up forgetting about the deaf community or the ones visually impaired and how they will become aware of your program. Think about how an individual with diminished memory will collect information about your program for when they need it.</p>
                        <section>
                            <h4>Intersectionality</h4>
                            <p>To be truly inclusive, you need to think of your clients as complete human beings. A person with disability is more than just their disability. Everyone has multiple characteristics that we need to keep in mind.</p>
                            <p>Intersectionality is about a diversity of characteristics for which society, or your organization has created barriers that prevent some individuals from accessing services. Find out what characteristics are likely to be seen among your clients.</p>
                            <p>Always work toward finding out who are the remaining individuals not accessing your service. For programs that include people in vulnerable situations, it is unlikely that it is random individuals willingly choosing to opt out &ndash; and a small percentage of a large program is still a lot of clients. It may be those most in need that are missing out on the program intended to help them.</p>
                            <p>Although this playbook is focused on people with disabilities, here are other client demographics that can be intersecting, creating unique considerations for your service delivery:</p>
                            <ul class="lst-spcd">
                                <li><strong>Indigenous Peoples </strong>&ndash; In 2017, 32% of First Nations people living off reserve, 30% of M&eacute;tis and 19% of Inuit had one or more disabilities that limited them in their daily activities.<sup id="ftnref2"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#ftn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup> This intersects with considerations specific to this community, such as: location, language, historical relationship with the government. Many remote, on-reserve communities do not have paved roads, easy internet access (satellite only, for example), fly-in only communities.</li>
                                <li><strong>Poverty</strong> &ndash; living in poverty implies the individual is in a more precarious situation meaning that service delivery problems can have more dramatic impacts on outcomes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Youth</strong> &ndash; mental health-related disabilities are the most prevalent type of disability: 8% of Canadians between age 15 and 24 years.<sup id="ftnref3-1"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#ftn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup></li>
                                <li><strong>Seniors</strong> &ndash; almost half (47%) of seniors over age 75 report have a disability. Dexterity, hearing and physical disabilities increase significantly with age. <sup id="ftnref3-2"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#ftn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup></li>
                                <li><strong>LGBTQ2+</strong> &ndash; In addition to the challenges created by society at large, transgender persons may have increased need to deal with government while transitioning genders, which may coincide with temporary disabilities.</li>
                                <li><strong>Victims of violence</strong> &ndash; survivors of domestic violence have a significantly higher likelihood of brain-related injuries, such as concussions.</li>
                                <li><strong>People living in rural and remote locations</strong>.</li>
                                <li><strong>People who are incarcerated and/or previously incarcerated</strong>.</li>
                                <li><strong>Visible minority groups</strong>.</li>
                                <li><strong>Newcomers</strong>.</li>
                                <li><strong>Women</strong> &ndash; 24% of women are more likely to have a disability than men (20%).<sup id="ftnref3-3"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#ftn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup></li>
                                </li>

                        <h3>Good decisions that create a positive experience</h3>
                        <p>Inclusive design aims to remove the service barriers that affects your client's ability to obtain the services to which they are entitled.</p>
                        <p>When you develop services, each decision can limit the accessibility of the service. Few policy objectives start out inaccessible; they become less accessible as you make decisions about applications, reporting, interacting, etc.. Some of those decisions may be necessary, perhaps for integrity, but has every alternative really been considered?</p>
                        <p>After exploring all alternatives, the remaining barriers can be examined to determine how to get around them when they affect someone's ability to access the service. Service design needs to be proactive in finding solutions before the barrier affects a client.</p>
                        <p>Government uses multiple channels to deliver programs and services. These mainly include<strong> in-person</strong>, <strong>phone</strong> and <strong>online</strong>. No one channel is accessible for everyone hence alternative approaches are key to inclusion.</p>
                        <section>
                            <h4>Curb cut effect</h4>
                            <p>While accessibility focuses on key considerations for persons with disabilities, inclusive design considers from the start, how something might be easy and useful for as many people as possible. One example is the curb cut effect &ndash; a term used to describe what happens when an accessibility feature benefits more people than the group it was originally intended for, such as a ramp or path for wheelchair users. This also benefit parents pushing strollers, users of walking aids or people carrying heavy packages.</p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h4>Everyone is unique</h4>
                            <p>Experiences of disability vary. Some disabilities are considered mild, and some more severe. Some are progressive, some fluctuate, and some are stable. Some individuals are born with a disability, and many develop them later in life. 71% of persons with disabilities have more than one type of disability, and so may experience a variety of disability experiences. All individuals with disabilities need to have access to services.</p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h4>It&rsquo;s about the person</h4>
                            <p>What a client could or could not do last time is not what they can do this time. Approximately 60% of persons with disabilities have conditions that are changing over time (progressive, recurrent, fluctuating). Clients need to be able to decide how they want to access services, every time.</p>
                            <p>As a service provider, service design should not assume that a family member or personal care giver will perform tasks on behalf of someone living with a type of disability or functional limitations. Their personal information deserves privacy. Persons with disabilities are like everyone else, they have the right to access information and services themselves.</p>
                        </section>

                        <section>
                            <h4>Accessibility requires more than one service channel</h4>
                            <p>One third of persons with disabilities have difficulties accessing at least one service channel.</p>
