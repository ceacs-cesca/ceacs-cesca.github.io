                            <p>Have patience and be accommodating. For example, recognize there may be a need to repeat information.</p>
                            <p>Make clients feel welcome and confident to have an open expression of opinions without fear of being judged or dismissed. Encourage persons with disabilities to speak for themselves. Listen actively and engage in dialogue.</p>
                            <ul class="lst-spcd">
                                <li>Ask before you help. Don&rsquo;t assume the person needs help.</li>
                                <li>Don&rsquo;t make assumptions about the type of disability a person has or about what accommodation needs they may have.&nbsp;</li>
                                <li>Some disabilities are not visible and clients are not required to tell you about their disabilities.</li>
                                <li>Speak directly to your client, not to their support person or companion.</li>
                                <li>Take the time to get to know your client&rsquo;s needs and focus on meeting those needs just as you would with any other client.</li>
                                <li>Listen carefully. If you&rsquo;re not sure what your client is saying, confirm by summarizing or repeating what was said to you, or politely ask them to repeat it.</li>
                                <li>Be patient. People with some type of disabilities may take a little longer to respond or do things.</li>
                                <li>Use appropriate language and terminology when referring to people with disabilities.&nbsp;</li>

                        <h3>Interact respectfully with someone who uses a service animal</h3>
                        <p>A service animal is any guide dog, signal dog or other animal individually trained to assist a person with a disability. Each animal is trained to perform various tasks and provide a range of services.</p>
                        <p>A service animal is not a pet. It should be treated like an extension of their owner&rsquo;s arm. The rules and licensing for service animals are different for each province, many do not issue permits or regulate the training of animals.</p>
                        <section>
                            <h4>Best practices with someone who uses a service animal</h4>
                            <ul class="lst-spcd">
                                <li>Do not request that the owner leaves the animal in different location, such as outside of your office or classroom.</li>
                                <li>Avoid petting or talking to a service animal: this distracts the animal from its tasks.</li>
                                <li>Do not feed or offer treats to the animal.</li>
                                <li>Avoid deliberately startling the animal.&nbsp;</li>
                                <li>Remember not all service animals wear special collars or harnesses. If you are not sure and it is necessary that you verify, it is okay to ask the owner if it is a service animal.&nbsp;</li>
                                <li>Remember that the owner is responsible for maintaining control over the animal at all time. You are not responsible for cleaning up after it or feeding it. You may provide water if the owner requests it.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="mrgn-tp-lg">Dogs are by far the most common type of animal used to assist people with visual impairments. However, many different types of animals can be used and assist other types of disabilities:</p>
                            <ul class="lst-spcd">
                                <li><strong>A guide dog</strong> serves as a travel aid for a person with vision loss.</li>
                                <li><strong>A hearing or signal animal</strong> alerts a person with hearing loss when a sound occurs, such as knock on the door or alarm.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mobility assistance animals</strong> may carry, fetch, open doors, ring doorbells, activate elevator buttons, pull a wheelchair, steady a person while walking or help someone get up after a fall.</li>
                                <li><strong>A seizure response animal</strong> warns a person of an impending seizure or provides aid during a seizure such as going for help or standing guard over the person.</li>
                                <li><strong>Therapeutic assistance animals</strong> aid people with cognitive or psychological disabilities by bringing a phone to the person in emergency, turning on the lights, fetching medication, barking for help in emergency or assisting a person with panic disorder coping in crowds.</li>
                            </ul>
